# Coders-of-Delhi

This project focuses on data cleaning and data preprocessing to build simple yet powerful features such as:

ðŸ‘¥ People you may know

ðŸ“š Books you may like

â€¦and many more recommendation-style features.

Unlike most projects, this one is purely built in Python without using any external libraries â€” everything is implemented from scratch to better understand the fundamentals of data handling and preprocessing.
